##Project Description
The Gmail Clone project is a full-stack web application that replicates the basic functionalities of the popular email service Gmail. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), this project aims to provide users with a familiar email experience while also showcasing the integration of SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) for sending and receiving emails.

##Key Features
Email Management: Users can manage their emails using familiar features such as Inbox, Sent, Drafts, Bin (Trash), and Starred.
Drafts: Users can compose emails and save them as drafts for later editing and sending.
Starred Emails: Users can mark emails as starred for quick access and reference.
SMTP Integration: The application integrates with an SMTP server for sending and receiving emails, allowing seamless communication between users.
Responsive Design: The user interface is designed to be responsive, providing a consistent experience across various devices and screen sizes.

##Technology Stack
Frontend: The frontend of the application is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Backend: The backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js, providing a robust server-side environment for handling requests and managing data.
Database: MongoDB is used as the database to store user information, email data, and other application-related data.
SMTP: The application integrates with an SMTP server (e.g., Gmail SMTP) to handle email sending and receiving functionalities.

##Purpose
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of essential email functionalities using modern web development technologies. It serves as a learning resource for developers interested in building full-stack web applications, integrating third-party services like SMTP, and creating intuitive user interfaces for email management.
